## 1. Executive Summary & Investigation Scope

Automated surface water quality monitoring is fundamental to environmental preservation, agricultural safety, and public water supply management. Conventional water sampling workflows are constrained by laboratory incubation latency (e.g., 5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand, $\text{BOD}_5$) and discrete geospatial coverage. 

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) establishes the empirical, statistical, and geochemical foundation for Phase 1 (Applied Machine Learning) and Phase 2 (Deep Learning) predictive modeling. 

Our analysis investigates **2,827,977 raw monitoring records** collected across **5 sovereign nations** over an **83-year temporal span (1940–2023)**. Rather than relying on superficial summary statistics, this investigation validates sensor physics, empirical distributions, geochemical laws (Henry's Law gas solubility, nutrient stoichiometry), long-term temporal trends, and anti-leakage target quarantine protocols.

| **Global Total** | **Consolidated Multi-National Master Repository** | **2,827,977** | **2,819,617** | **100.00%** |

### 2.2 Feature Dimensions & Semantic Roles

The repository contains exactly 14 columns partitioned into three functional tiers:

```

## 3. Data Integrity & 100% Complete Ground Truth

A programmatic null-value audit was conducted across every row and column of the master unified dataset:

```python
# Programmatic Null Count Verification
null_counts = {col: df[col].isnull().sum() for col in df.columns}
# Result: 0 null entries across all 14 columns
```

### Key Data Integrity Findings:
1. **Zero Missingness Across All Features:** Every single record in the unified dataset contains complete, concurrent measurements for all 8 aquatic chemical parameters, date, location, and computed indices.
2. **Zero Imputation Bias:** Because the dataset possesses **100% complete-case ground truth**, no synthetic imputation (mean, median, mode, or k-Nearest Neighbors) is required or applied. Models train exclusively on authentic, empirically measured water chemistry.
3. **Temporal Span:** Sampling dates range from historical baselines (1940) through contemporary telemetry (2023), with >95% of observations concentrated in the modern regulatory monitoring era (2000–2023).

## 4. Domain-Informed Physical Bounds & Sensor Telemetry Screening

Environmental field telemetry inevitably captures transient hardware malfunctions, cable disconnections, and sensor calibration drifts. Rather than applying blunt statistical distance heuristics (which inadvertently strip genuine high-pollution discharge events), screening boundaries were derived from **aquatic chemistry and thermodynamics**:

| Parameter | Valid Physical Range | Corrupted Count | Screening Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pH (pH units)** | $[3.0, 12.0]$ | 1,581 (0.056%) | Surface freshwaters cannot sustain $\text{pH} < 3.0$ or $> 12.0$ outside extreme caustic spills; removes scale bugs (e.g., $\text{pH} = 67,115$). |
| **Temperature (°C)** | $[0.0, 45.0]$ | 81 (0.003%) | Constrained by liquid freshwater phase boundary at 1 atm; removes $-999999.0$ hardware disconnect codes. |
| **Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)**| $[0.0, 25.0]$ | 1 (0.000%) | Upper limit bound by atmospheric equilibrium and photosynthetic supersaturation. |
| **Ammonia ($\text{NH}_4^+$ mg/L)**| $\ge 0.0$ | 1,240 (0.044%) | Physical mass concentrations cannot be negative; clips zero-drift offsets. |
| **$\text{BOD}_5$ (mg/L)** | $\ge 0.0$ | 2,104 (0.074%) | Microbiological oxygen consumption cannot be negative. |
| **Orthophosphate ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ mg/L)**| $\ge 0.0$ | 1,890 (0.067%) | Analytical phosphorus mass cannot be negative. |
| **Nitrate ($\text{NO}_3^-$ mg/L)**| $\ge 0.0$ | 740 (0.026%) | Nutrient concentration cannot be negative. |
| **Total Nitrogen (mg/L)** | $\ge 0.0$ | 723 (0.026%) | Nutrient concentration cannot be negative. |
| **Total Corrupted Records Purged** | — | **8,360 (0.296%)** | **Production Clean Volume: 2,819,617 Observations** |

## 5. Statistical Distributions & Skewness Analysis

Summary statistics for the 8 chemical parameters across the 2,819,617 clean complete observations:

| Parameter | Unit | Mean | Median | Std Dev | Min | Max | Skewness ($\gamma_1$) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **pH** | pH units | 7.78 | 7.82 | 0.49 | 3.01 | 11.90 | $-0.32$ (Symmetric) |
| **Temperature** | °C | 12.41 | 12.50 | 5.12 | 0.00 | 44.80 | $+0.18$ (Symmetric) |
| **Dissolved Oxygen**| mg/L | 9.82 | 10.00 | 2.18 | 0.00 | 24.80 | $-0.45$ (Symmetric) |
| **Ammonia** | mg/L | 0.18 | 0.05 | 0.68 | 0.00 | 88.00 | $+18.42$ (Highly Skewed) |
| **$\text{BOD}_5$** | mg/L | 2.14 | 1.60 | 2.31 | 0.00 | 120.00 | $+9.85$ (Highly Skewed) |
| **Orthophosphate** | mg/L | 0.24 | 0.06 | 0.72 | 0.00 | 54.20 | $+14.28$ (Highly Skewed) |
| **Nitrate** | mg/L | 18.45 | 16.20 | 14.10 | 0.00 | 158.00 | $+1.42$ (Moderately Skewed) |
| **Total Nitrogen** | mg/L | 5.82 | 4.10 | 5.48 | 0.00 | 145.00 | $+3.84$ (Highly Skewed) |

### Key Distributional Insights:
- **Physical Probes:** pH, Temperature, and Dissolved Oxygen exhibit near-Gaussian bell curves ($\gamma_1 \in [-0.45, +0.18]$) centered around natural equilibrium states.
- **Nutrient Concentrations:** Orthophosphate, Ammonia, and $\text{BOD}_5$ span up to 4 orders of magnitude with severe positive skewness ($\gamma_1 > 9$). Applying non-linear $\log(1+x)$ transformations compresses this dynamic range, stabilizing gradient propagation in neural networks and amplifying linear feature correlation.

## 6. Geochemical Physics & Stoichiometric Relationships

### 6.1 Henry's Law & Dissolved Oxygen Saturation
Aquatic gas solubility is inversely proportional to water temperature. Theoretical oxygen saturation capacity $DO_{\text{sat}}(T)$ was evaluated using the Benson & Krause (1984) formulation:
$$DO_{\text{sat}}(T) \approx 14.652 - 0.41022 T + 0.007991 T^2 - 0.000077774 T^3$$

Observations track the 100% saturation curve across cold winter waters ($14\text{ mg/L}$ at $0^\circ\text{C}$) to warm summer waters ($7.5\text{ mg/L}$ at $30^\circ\text{C}$). Rare supersaturation ($>120\%$) correlates with intense summer photosynthetic activity.

### 6.2 Redfield Ratio & Nutrient Stoichiometry
Freshwater algal growth is governed by the stoichiometric nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio:
$$\text{N:P Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Nitrogen (mg/L)}}{\text{Orthophosphate (mg/L)}}$$
- **Redfield Benchmark:** $\text{N:P} = 16:1$ (by mass).
- **Finding:** Over $62\%$ of monitoring records exhibit $\text{N:P} > 16$, demonstrating that freshwater ecosystems are predominantly **phosphorus-limited**. Consequently, controlling phosphorus (orthophosphate) is the critical environmental intervention for halting eutrophication.

## 7. Bivariate Correlations with CCME WQI

Linear (Pearson $r$), non-linear monotonic (Spearman $\rho$), and transformed correlations with the continuous target `CCME_Values`:

| Feature | Raw Pearson $r$ | Spearman Rank $\rho$ | $\log(1+x)$ Pearson $r$ | Direction & Ecological Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Orthophosphate** | $-0.66$ | $\mathbf{-0.78}$ | $\mathbf{-0.85}$ | Primary negative driver; excess phosphorus causes algal blooms. |
| **Total Nitrogen** | $-0.61$ | $-0.69$ | $-0.74$ | Strong negative driver; agricultural fertilizer runoff. |
| **Ammonia** | $-0.39$ | $-0.52$ | $-0.63$ | Negative driver; toxic organic decomposition byproduct. |
| **$\text{BOD}_5$** | $-0.32$ | $-0.46$ | $-0.58$ | Negative driver; microbial oxygen depletion. |
| **Dissolved Oxygen**| $+0.42$ | $+0.48$ | $+0.44$ | Positive driver; vital for aerobic aquatic respiration. |
| **pH** | $+0.12$ | $+0.15$ | $+0.12$ | Weak correlation; extreme alkaline/acidic values penalized. |
| **Temperature** | $-0.18$ | $-0.21$ | $-0.19$ | Negative driver; warmer water holds less oxygen. |

*Observation:* Applying $\log(1+x)$ to orthophosphate increases linear correlation with CCME WQI from $-0.66$ to $\mathbf{-0.85}$ (a $+28.8\%$ gain), providing tree models and neural networks with an exceptionally strong predictive signal.

## 8. Target Variable Distribution & Class Breakdown

The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (**CCME WQI**) combines Scope ($F_1$), Frequency ($F_2$), and Amplitude ($F_3$) into a continuous scale from 0 to 100:

$$\text{CCME WQI} = 100 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + F_3^2}}{1.732} \right)$$

### Discrete Regulatory Tiers (`CCME_WQI`):

| Regulatory Tier | CCME Score Range | Record Count | Percentage (%) | Ecological Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Excellent** | $95.0 - 100.0$ | 1,404,169 | 49.80% | Pristine; virtual absence of impairment |
| **Good** | $80.0 - 94.9$ | 905,097 | 32.10% | Desirable; conditions rarely depart from natural levels |
| **Fair** | $65.0 - 79.9$ | 208,652 | 7.40% | Acceptable; conditions occasionally compromised |
| **Marginal** | $45.0 - 64.9$ | 205,832 | 7.30% | Impaired; conditions frequently depart from desirable levels |
| **Poor** | $0.0 - 44.9$ | 95,867 | 3.40% | Heavily polluted; chronic threat to aquatic life |
| **Total** | **$0.0 - 100.0$** | **2,819,617** | **100.00%** | **Full Multi-National Dataset** |

## 9. Modeling Implications for Applied ML & Deep Learning

1. **Stratified Partitioning:** The class imbalance (Poor represents 3.4% vs Excellent 49.8%) mandates stratified 70/15/15 sampling to ensure identical tier representation across Train (1,973,731), Validation (422,943), and Test (422,943) sets.
2. **Target Quarantine Protocol:** Naive retention of guideline excursion intermediate terms ($F_1, F_2, F_3$) causes 100% circular target leakage. Intermediate exceedance counters must be strictly quarantined from predictor matrices.
3. **Feature Importance Expectation:** Given orthophosphate's $-0.85$ correlation with WQI, TreeSHAP feature attribution is expected to identify phosphorus as the dominant split variable across gradient boosted ensembles.
4. **Multi-Task Neural Architecture:** Combining continuous Smooth L1 regression with class-weighted cross-entropy in a Dual-Head MLP enables simultaneous score estimation and robust minority-tier ('Poor') recall.
